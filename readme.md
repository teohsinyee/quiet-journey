# Quiet Journey

This is my personal journey of reading the Bible one chapter a day.  
I realized I often worked hard in life and learning, but neglected God’s Word.

Here you’ll find:
- **Daily reflections** on Scripture (1 chapter a day, starting from the New Testament).
- **Open questions** I wrestle with — sometimes unanswered for now.
- **Reading plan** that covers the New Testament in 260 days.

### Why public?

Because I don’t want to remain a beginner forever.  
Sharing openly keeps me accountable, and I hope it provokes curiosity — whether you’re a non-believer, a new believer, or a long-time Christian.

## 🛠️ For myself (site maintainer)

### Daily workflow
1. Read today’s chapter (see [Reading Plan](./docs/pages/reading-plan.md)).
2. Create a note in `/docs/notes/`  
   - filename: `YYYY-MM-DD-book-chapter.md`  
   - use `_template_reflection.md` as structure.
3. Update `/docs/data/manifest.json`  
   - Add new entry (title, date, path, excerpt).
4. If I have new questions:  
   - Use Open Questions page → Generate snippet  
   - Paste into `/docs/data/open-questions.json`.
5. Commit and push.
