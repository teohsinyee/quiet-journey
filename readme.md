# Quiet Journey

This is my personal journey of reading the Bible one chapter a day.
I realized I often worked hard in life and learning, but neglected God’s Word.

Here you’ll find:
- **Daily reflections** on Scripture (1 chapter a day, starting from the New Testament).
- **Open questions** I wrestle with — sometimes unanswered for now.
- **Reading plan** that covers the New Testament in 260 days.

### Why public?

Because I don’t want to remain a beginner forever.
Sharing openly keeps me accountable, and I hope it provokes curiosity — whether you’re a non-believer, a new believer, or a long-time Christian.

## 🛠️ For myself (site maintainer)

### Daily workflow
1. Read today’s chapter (see [Reading Plan](./docs/pages/reading-plan.md)).
2. Visit [the CMS](./docs/admin/) (powered by Decap CMS) and log in with GitHub via the OAuth proxy.
3. Add a new entry in **Notes** and save.
4. GitHub Actions auto-generate `manifest.json` and the site publishes within minutes.
5. To track questions, use the **Open Questions** collection or the in-site helper to append to `open-questions.json`.
