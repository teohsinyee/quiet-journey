# 2025-09-10 - Matthew 7

## Passage

Matthew 7

## Summary

This is the continuation of the Sermon on the Mount, covering how we should manage ourselves, discern others, and pay attention to the source of teachings.

## About God

* **God as Father (v11)**
  *Reflection:* God is our loving Father who cares about us in every situation. He will never forsake us.

  *ChatGPT5 Feedback:* Good reminder of His character. Be careful not to interpret “God gives good gifts” as always giving what I want. His care may look different from my expectations, but it is always good.

* **God’s concern for the heart (v21)**
  *Reflection:* God cares about the intrinsic motivation of our actions and whether we truly put His kingdom first.

  *ChatGPT5 Feedback:* Correct. Just remember this means obedience matters as much as motivation. God is not fooled by words alone — faith and action must align.

## About People

* **Wide vs. Narrow Gate (v13–14)**
  *Reflection:* Most people choose what is convenient (the wide gate) because it requires less patience and effort. Few choose the narrow gate that requires perseverance.

  *ChatGPT5 Feedback:* True observation. Guard your own heart — don’t only use this verse to describe “other people.” The temptation to choose convenience over obedience is also in me.

## To Christ

* **Christ’s warning (v21)**
  *Reflection:* Christ is transparent with people by revealing the truth: God will not recognize those who call Him “Lord” but ignore God’s will.

  *ChatGPT5 Feedback:* This shows Christ’s honesty and authority. Be careful not to treat this only as a warning for “false believers out there.” It is also an invitation to self-examination: is my discipleship in words only, or in actual obedience?

## Application

* **Discernment of leaders (v15–19)**
  *Reflection:* I must have discernment when looking at leaders. It is a red flag when they consistently bear bad fruit.

  *ChatGPT5 Feedback:* Good principle. But also apply it inward: ask, “What fruit am I bearing in my own life?” Discernment must not become suspicion but a way to keep both myself and my community healthy.

## Open Questions

1. It’s interesting that “Judging Others” is included here. Why did Jesus mention this? Is judgmentalism part of human nature, like jealousy and insecurity?

   *ChatGPT5 Feedback:* Likely yes — Jesus knew our tendency to magnify others’ faults while excusing our own. His command corrects this imbalance, not to stop discernment altogether but to stop hypocrisy.

2. Practically, how do I discern what is healthy vs. unhealthy judgment?

   *ChatGPT5 Feedback:* Healthy judgment = discernment that protects truth and love. Unhealthy judgment = condemnation that elevates me above others. The difference lies in humility and purpose: am I aiming to restore or to tear down?

## Personal Experiences

* **Losing empathy (v12)**
  *Reflection:* One of my team leaders gave me similar advice. When I face a problem, my focus shifts fully onto the solution. I become impatient and lose empathy for people. Deep down, I blame them for causing the problem. Without patience and empathy, my words become harsh, hurtful, and fail to glorify the Lord.

  *ChatGPT5 Feedback:* Honest reflection. Be careful of “solution-first, people-last.” This habit damages relationships long-term. Matthew 7:12 calls me to reverse the order: treat others as I want to be treated, even under stress.

* **Labeling people (v7)**
  *Reflection:* As an INTJ, I naturally notice flaws in people and label them without deeper understanding. The result is relational gaps, hurt, and guilt. Long-term, this cycle is detrimental. I’m still searching for practical ways to correct my heart and behavior.

  *ChatGPT5 Feedback:* Very insightful. Remember, noticing flaws can be a gift if used for prayer and support, not for judgment. Ask God to turn “quick discernment” into “quick compassion.”

## Prayer

Dear Lord, help me not to walk the easy wide road of convenience, but to persevere in the narrow path of obedience. Keep me from empty words and teach me to live out Your will sincerely. Give me discernment without judgmentalism, and patience with people instead of only chasing solutions. Transform my habit of labeling flaws into a heart of compassion.

## Feelings

* Many metaphors in this chapter are beautiful and memorable.
* The imagery of wide and narrow gates, trees and fruit, houses on rock or sand stays vivid in my mind.
* A few words caught my attention and stayed with me: **choose obedience over convenience, faith and action must align, self-examination, compassion.**
