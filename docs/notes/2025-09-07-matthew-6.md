# 2025-09-07 - Matthew 6

## Passage

Matthew 6

## Summary

Jesus gave practical teachings on giving, praying, fasting, storing treasures, and dealing with worry. He emphasized that God values sincerity of the heart more than outward appearance.

## About God

God cares not only about what I do, but why I do it. 

## About People

People are easily drawn to show off spirituality. Some become hypocrites, doing religious acts as a way to gain attention or validation from others instead of seeking God. Human nature tends to use even good things like prayer or charity as bait for recognition.

## To Christ

* **Christ’s values vs. worldly values**
  *Question:* What does this chapter show me about Christ’s values compared to worldly values?

  *Reflection:* Christ cares about the heart. Everything I do should be for the Lord, not to gain fame or become proud. The world, however, obsesses over possessions and validation, like buying luxury cars to please people.

  *ChatGPT5 Feedback:* Good contrast. Just remember not to let “world vs. Christ” thinking make you self-righteous. The danger is judging others’ luxury while missing my own hidden pride. Keep the focus on purity of heart before God, not comparing lifestyles.

* **The Lord’s Prayer and His heart**
  *Question:* How does His teaching on prayer (the Lord’s Prayer) reveal His heart for His followers?

  *Reflection:* Humans are easily tempted, so we need to diligently pray for His protection.

  *ChatGPT5 Feedback:* True, but don’t miss that the Lord’s Prayer also shows His care for daily needs (“our daily bread”), forgiveness, and alignment with His kingdom. Prayer is not only defense against temptation, but also relationship with a loving Father.

## Application

* **Giving in secret (v1–4)**
  *Question:* In giving, do I prefer people to know my generosity, or am I content if only God knows?

  *Reflection:* It’s ok if no one knows. As long as the recipient receives the help, that’s fine.

  *ChatGPT5 Feedback:* Healthy view. But even when no one sees, pride can still creep in. Ask God to purify motives so giving is worship, not just a good deed.

* **Prayer aligned with God’s will (v5–15)**
  *Question:* Do I often pray more about my wants than aligning with God’s will?

  *Reflection:* For every prayer, I tell God: let Your will be done, because His plan is best for me.

  *ChatGPT5 Feedback:* Excellent mindset. But be careful it’s not just a formula. True surrender means trusting God’s goodness even when His plan looks very different from what I hoped.

* **Fasting with sincerity (v16–18)**
  *Question:* Do I ever do spiritual activities for appearance rather than sincerity?

  *Reflection:* No. I fast in the early morning when no one else is awake.

  *ChatGPT5 Feedback:* That’s sincere. But fasting is not only about secrecy; it’s about seeking God with hunger for Him. Make sure the focus is intimacy with God, not just “quiet practice.”

* **Handing worry to God (v25–34)**
  *Question:* What is one specific worry I can hand over to God this week?

  *Reflection:* I’m the weakest person in my mission trip team. I’ll need to pray for strangers, share testimony publicly, worship with the team on stage, and play with kids in a foreign country. I’m very inexperienced but grateful for the learning opportunity. I worry because I don’t know how to pray for strangers publicly. At the same time, my weakness will magnify God’s grace and power if things go well.

  *ChatGPT5 Feedback:* Beautiful humility. Don’t let “I am the weakest” become fear or self-pity. Paul says in 2 Corinthians 12:9 — God’s power is made perfect in weakness. Enter the mission trip expecting Him to carry you, not yourself.

## Open Questions

* How can I easily discern if I am serving God or recognition in practice?

## Personal Experiences

* **God’s provision in worry**
  *Question:* Was there a time I worried a lot, but God eventually provided?

  *Reflection:* Yes. I was overseas and several plans went wrong. But the next day, God surprised me with a plan beyond perfection.

  *ChatGPT5 Feedback:* A strong reminder of His faithfulness. Keep this as a testimony stone. Next time worry rises, recall His past provision.

* **Financial security vs. God’s kingdom**
  *Question:* Do I feel tension between pursuing financial security and seeking God’s kingdom first?

  *Reflection:* I’m financially okay. But sometimes I get consumed by job and achievements, making time with God the least urgent.

  *ChatGPT5 Feedback:* Honest admission. The danger here is subtle idolatry — not money itself, but letting achievement push God to last place. Keep practicing Matthew 6:33: seek His kingdom first, and trust provision will follow.

* **Peer pressure in prayer**
  *Question:* Have I ever felt pressure to make my prayer look more “spiritual” in front of others?

  *Reflection:* Yes. I once visited an AOG church where people prayed loudly and in tongues. Their prayers went on long while mine was short. I felt peer pressure: “Should I pretend to keep praying so I don’t look awkward?” But I didn’t pretend, I stayed sincere.

  *ChatGPT5 Feedback:* This is exactly Matthew 6 in action — choosing sincerity over performance. Don’t worry about length or style. Guard against pride in “being different,” but rejoice you chose honesty before God.

## Prayer

Dear Lord, help me to keep my intentions pure before You. Teach me to give, pray, and fast with sincerity, not for show. Please free me from worry, especially about my upcoming mission trip. Remind me that Your power is made perfect in my weakness. Help me to seek first Your kingdom above work, achievements, or people’s approval.
