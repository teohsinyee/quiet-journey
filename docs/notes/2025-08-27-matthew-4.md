# 2025-08-27 - Matthew 4

## Passage

Matthew 4

## Summary

Jesus was tested in the wilderness and then began His ministry on earth.

## About God

God had already determined the outcome, as seen in how Jesus’ move to Capernaum fulfilled what the prophet Isaiah had spoken.
“全心相信，祢已编好结局；
万事出必有因，靠主永不抖震”
——《仍能赞美》

## About People

* **Hunger/Needs (v3–4):**
  *Question:* When I’m tired, hungry, or stressed, do I look for quick fixes (snacks, scrolling on phone, complaining) instead of leaning on God’s Word?
  *Reflection:* When I am in those situations, I usually do everything except read God’s Word. I’ll eat, distract myself, or listen to an online sermon for encouragement. I don’t really know if listening to sermons is “less than” reading the Word. I just know I enjoy it and it helps me feel encouraged.

* **Safety/Testing God (v5–7):**
  *Question:* Have I ever said, “God, if You really care, prove it to me by fixing this situation my way”?
  *Reflection:* No, I never. I don’t dare to put God to the test.

* **Power/Control (v8–10):**
  *Question:* In my daily work or relationships, do I crave recognition, control, or being on top? How do I react when I’m tempted to compromise a little in order to gain approval, success, or shortcuts?
  *Reflection:* Yes, I do crave recognition and being at the top. Sometimes, when I am not in the right state, I may hide my mistakes. But most of the time, I choose integrity and admit my mistakes openly, even apologizing in front of others. In my workplace, it is rare to see people apologize, but I do it, and that feels like a small way of resisting compromise.

## To Christ

(No clear understanding yet)

## Application

1. **Facing Needs / Shortcuts (v3–4)**

   * When I am under pressure, I will try to endure a little longer instead of seeking immediate comfort.
   * Next, I will listen to a sermon and focus on it, so that negative thoughts don’t drill down. Sometimes it is really about focus, not on the problem but on God’s words.

2. **Testing God (v5–7)**

   * I realize I struggle with impatience and insecurity when I compare myself with others.
   * Sometimes feelings of defeat overwhelm me, and my way of coping is to retreat (like sleeping or distracting myself) instead of bringing it before God.

3. **Power / Recognition (v8–10)**

   * (Still reflecting)

4. **Calling of the Disciples (v18–22)**

   * My “net” could be my career.
   * It would be hard to let go because of the relationships I have built and people I care about.
   * But I know that if Jesus calls, I must follow Him, because He is the truth and my purpose.

## Open Questions

* Why would the Spirit lead Jesus to be tempted? Isn’t it pointless since surely Jesus would win as the Son of God?
* Why did Jesus choose Peter and Andrew as His first disciples? Was it just coincidence, like picking random people on the street?
* Why did Peter and Andrew drop everything and follow Jesus immediately? Did they truly know who He was?

## Prayer

Dear Lord, I admit that my insecurity has become a huge blocker in my life. It has often clouded my judgment, and I have made many wrong decisions in this state of mind. I want to get out of it.

Lord, especially when it comes to caring for others, I realize that my insecurity leads me to compete instead of love. In chasing results, I lose patience and compassion, and life becomes miserable.

Please, Father, renew my heart. Replace insecurity with security in You. Teach me to value people over achievements, love over competition, and obedience over comparison. Help me see that my worth is not in results, but in being Your child.

## Feelings

* Verse 7 caught my attention and reminded me of times when I have put God to the test.
* Verse 17 echoed that, urging me to repent quickly.
