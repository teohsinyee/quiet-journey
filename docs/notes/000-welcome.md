# My Intention

> "This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night..." - Joshua 1:8

I am a 1-year-old Christian. A deacon asked me a serious question: "Do you always want to remain a beginner?"
It woke me up. I had taken God's Word too lightly.

God created the world by His Word. His Word is powerful. Every day I want to return to it as dependence, not as a casual checkbox.

I confess that I relied on my abilities and neglected Scripture. A few months ago I tasted the sweetness of long meditation, then I let other priorities take over. Today I delay no more. Out of obedience, I commit to meditate on God's Word daily, like in Joshua 1:8.

**This site is my public journey of obedience.**
