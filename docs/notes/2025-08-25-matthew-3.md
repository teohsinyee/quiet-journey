## Open Questions
- Why was the baptism of Jesus recorded in the Bible? He could have performed miracles without baptism.
- Why does God bother with such a ritual (仪式感)?
- What was Jesus’s intention in asking John to baptize Him?
- Was it simply to set an example, or was there a deeper reason?

## Personal Experiences
- I haven’t been baptized yet. At times, I don’t really feel the need for baptism, even though many people have explained its importance to me. To me, what matters more are the heart and actions rather than a public declaration. Perhaps the fuller answer will be found later in Matthew 28:19. But I also know I cannot choose partial obedience. Even if I don’t understand fully, since God has commanded baptism, I should follow. I trust that understanding will come later. I’m not sure if I see this correctly, but this is where I am right now.

## Prayer
Dear Lord, what's Your plan for my baptism? Help me to understand the why. Soften my heart and give me fresh perspective, so that I may obey You wholeheartedly.

## Feelings
- After listening many times, I remain stuck on the same questions.
- Human explanations don’t satisfy me.
- I can only wait on God to open my understanding.
